# Perspective-projection-of-a-moving-3d-object
- view the position and three-dimensional orientation of a camera and an object;  - change the position and orientation of the camera (extrinsic parameters) and the object through three-dimensional translations and rotations;  - translations and rotations can be made both in relation to the world reference and in relation to the object / camera's own reference frame;  - view the object image generated by the camera;  - change the camera's intrinsic parameters (focal length, scale factor of each axis, main point)  - every time something is changed, the 3D view and the image generated by the camera must be updated.
